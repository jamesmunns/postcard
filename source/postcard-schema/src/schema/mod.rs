//! ## Schema types
//!
//! The types in this module are used to define the schema of a given data type.
//!
//! The **Postcard Data Model** is nearly identical to the **Serde Data Model**, however Postcard also
//! allows for one additional type, `Schema`, which maps to the [`NamedValue`] type, allowing
//! the schema of types to also be sent over the wire and implement the `Schema` trait.
//!
//! ## Borrowed vs Owned
//!
//! For reasons that have to do with allowing for arbitrarily sized and nexted schemas that
//! can be created at compile/const time, as well as being usable in `no-std` contexts, the
//! schema types in this module are implemented using a LOT of `&'static` references.
//!
//! This is useful in those limited contexts, however it makes it difficult to do things
//! like deserialize them, as you can't generally get static references at runtime without
//! a lot of leaking.
//!
//! For cases like this, the [`owned`] module exists, which has copies of all of the "borrowed"
//! versions of the Data Model types. These owned types implement `From` for their borrowed
//! counterpoint, so if you need to deserialize something, you probably want the Owned variant!
