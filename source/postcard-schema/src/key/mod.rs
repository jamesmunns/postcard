//! A hash-based "Key" tag for postcard-schema compatible types
//!
//! This originally was developed for use in postcard-rpc, but has more
//! general use as a general purpose type + usage tag.
//!
//! This key should NOT be relied on for memory safety purposes, validation
//! of the data should still be performed, like that done by serde. It should
//! be treated as misuse **resistant**, not misuse **proof**. It is possible
//! for there to be hash collisions, and as a non-cryptograpic hash, it is
//! likely trivial to intentionally cause a collision.

/// The `Key` uniquely identifies what "kind" of message this is.
///
/// In order to generate it, `postcard-schema` takes two pieces of data:
///
/// * a `&str` "path" URI, similar to how you would use URIs as part of an HTTP path
/// * The schema of the message type itself, using the [`Schema`] trait
///
/// [`Schema`]: crate::Schema
///
/// Specifically, we use [`Fnv1a`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function),
/// and produce a 64-bit digest, by first hashing the path, then hashing the
/// schema. Fnv1a is a non-cryptographic hash function, designed to be reasonably
/// efficient to compute even on small platforms like microcontrollers.
///
/// Changing **anything** about *either* of the path or the schema will produce
/// a drastically different `Key` value.
