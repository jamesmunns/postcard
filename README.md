# Postcard

Postcard is a `#![no_std]` focused serializer and deserializer for Serde.

Postcard aims to be convenient for developers in constrained environments, while
allowing for flexibility to customize behavior as needed.

## Design Goals

1. Design primarily for `#![no_std]` usage, in embedded or other constrained contexts
2. Support a maximal set of `serde` features, so `postcard` can be used as a drop in replacement
3. Avoid special differences in code between communication code written for a microcontroller or a desktop/server PC
4. Be resource efficient - memory usage, code size, developer time, and CPU time; in that order
5. Allow library users to customize the serialization and deserialization  behavior to fit their bespoke needs

## Format Stability

As of v1.0.0, `postcard` has a documented and stable wire format. More information about this
wire format can be found in the `spec/` folder of the Postcard repository, or viewed online
at <https://postcard.jamesmunns.com>.

Work towards the Postcard Specification and portions of the Postcard 1.0 Release
were sponsored by Mozilla Corporation.

## Variable Length Data

All signed and unsigned integers larger than eight bits are encoded using a [Varint].
This includes the length of array slices, as well as the discriminant of `enums`.

For more information, see the [Varint] chapter of the wire specification.

## Example - Serialization/Deserialization

Postcard can serialize and deserialize messages similar to other `serde` formats.

Using the default `heapless` feature to serialize to a `heapless::Vec<u8>`:

```rust
use core::ops::Deref;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use postcard::{from_bytes, to_vec};
use heapless::Vec;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
struct RefStruct<'a> {
    bytes: &'a [u8],
    str_s: &'a str,
}
let message = "hElLo";
let bytes = [0x01, 0x10, 0x02, 0x20];
let output: Vec<u8, 11> = to_vec(&RefStruct {
    bytes: &bytes,
    str_s: message,
}).unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    &[0x04, 0x01, 0x10, 0x02, 0x20, 0x05, b'h', b'E', b'l', b'L', b'o',],
    output.deref()
);

let out: RefStruct = from_bytes(output.deref()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(
    out,
    RefStruct {
        bytes: &bytes,
        str_s: message,
    }
);
```

Or the optional `alloc` feature to serialize to an `alloc::vec::Vec<u8>`:

```rust
use core::ops::Deref;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use postcard::{from_bytes, to_allocvec};
extern crate alloc;
use alloc::vec::Vec;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
struct RefStruct<'a> {
    bytes: &'a [u8],
    str_s: &'a str,
}
let message = "hElLo";
let bytes = [0x01, 0x10, 0x02, 0x20];
let output: Vec<u8> = to_allocvec(&RefStruct {
    bytes: &bytes,
    str_s: message,
}).unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    &[0x04, 0x01, 0x10, 0x02, 0x20, 0x05, b'h', b'E', b'l', b'L', b'o',],
    output.deref()
);

let out: RefStruct = from_bytes(output.deref()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(
    out,
    RefStruct {
        bytes: &bytes,
        str_s: message,
    }
);
```

## Flavors

`postcard` supports a system called `Flavors`, which are used to modify the way
postcard serializes or processes serialized data. These flavors act as "plugins" or "middlewares"
during the serialization or deserialization process, and can be combined to obtain complex protocol formats.

See the documentation of the `ser_flavors` or `de_flavors` modules for more information on usage.

## Setup - `Cargo.toml`

Don't forget to add [the `no-std` subset](https://serde.rs/no-std.html) of `serde` along with `postcard` to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`!

```toml
[dependencies]
postcard = "1.0.0"

# By default, `serde` has the `std` feature enabled, which makes it unsuitable for embedded targets
# disabling default-features fixes this
serde = { version = "1.0.*", default-features = false }
```
